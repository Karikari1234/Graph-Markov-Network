> Graph Markov Network for Traffic Forecasting with Missing Data

### Introduction
This is the github repo for sharing the code for implementing the Graph Markov Network proposed in [1]. 

For most details of the Graph Markov Network, you can refer to this \[[post](https://zhiyongcui.com/blog/2020/07/16/graph-markov-network.html)\] and the paper ( \[[TR Part C](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X20305866)\] or \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05457)\]).
